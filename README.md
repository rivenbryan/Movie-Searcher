# Movie Searcher App
A simple React App used to search for Movies. Data is fetched from OMDb API (The Open Movie Database). The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by them.

In this application, I used material UI to style the CSS components. For more information, https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
This Movie-searcher is optimized on Mobile devices as well.

## To-be-updated
- Update FilterState whenever a User keys in an input
- Add Footer Element
- Add more links to each of the Card component
