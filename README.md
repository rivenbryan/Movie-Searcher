# Movie Searcher App
A simple React App used to search for Movies. Data is fetched from OMDb API (The Open Movie Database). The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by them.

In this application, I used material UI to style the CSS components. 

## Installation
